<h1> Welcome to Charlie's Programming Portfolio Website</h1>
My name is <strong>Charlie Flores-Angel</strong> and this is a website I made in my CSC 106 The Joy of Programming class at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island</a> to compile the programs and applications I wrote.<br>
<br> I wrote this website by using HTML coding as my first assigment of the semester of Sprind 2023.
