<h1> About Me! </h1>
        <p> My name is Carlos Flores-Angel, or as most people call me, "<strong>Charlie</strong>".
	<br> I was born in San Diego, California and moved around a lot while growing up, living in southern California, northern Mexico,<br> central Mexico, and Wisconsin.<br> </p>

<br>
	<p>I am an undergrad student at <a href="http://www.uri.edu">URI</a> double majoring in History and Anthropology. Some of my main passions are literature, <br> music, and cooking. One of my major accomplishments is having started a baking business at 15 with my mom that is still <br> run today by my older sister. I enjoy discussions with my peers on these topics and academic subjects. 
	Some of my main <br> academic interests are Latin American studies, ancient history, and non-Eurocentric historical accounts. </p>
